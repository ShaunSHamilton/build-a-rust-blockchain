### --description--

Start by creating a new directory called `src`.

_Tom, once you save, the tests should run_

```rust
fn main() {
  let my_str: &str = "Wow! Rust is rendered with colour to the terminal!";
}
```

### --tests--

You can use the command `mkdir src` to create the directory.

```js
const files = await __helpers.getDirectory(".");
console.log("files: ", files);
assert.include(files ?? "", "src");
```

### --description--

Tom, create a file named `index.js` within `src`.

### --tests--

You should add the file `src/index.js`. If you are seeing this, Tom, I am worried about you...

```js
// TODO: add helpers to look for files/folders
assert(true);
```

Tom, here is some code you can add to your window. This shows you what a long sentence will look like, as well as allows us to test prismjs within the terminal.

```js
console.log("Hello, Tom");
```

### --tests--

```js
assert(true);
```
